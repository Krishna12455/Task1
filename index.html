<h1><b>HTML</b> </h1>
<pHyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a file intended for display on the internet.<br> The markup tells web browsers how to display a webpage’s words and images.</p>
<p>Each individual piece markup code (which would fall between “<” and “>” characters) is referred to as an element, though many people also refer to it as a tag.<BR>	 Some elements come in pairs that indicate when some display effect is to begin and when it is to end.</p>
<h1><b>CSS</b></h1>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media</p> 
<p>It's a crucial technology for web development, allowing designers to separate presentation from content. CSS is used to create visual styles, layouts, and animations for web pages, making it an essential tool for web designers and developers</p>

<h1><b>JAVASCRIPT</b></h1>
 <p>JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language primarily used to create interactive and dynamic content on websites.<br> It allows developers to implement functionality like animations, form validations, dynamic content updates, and much more.<br>x JavaScript is essential for modern web development and is widely supported across all browsers.
</p>

<h1><b>NODEJS</b></h1>
<p>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side.<br> It was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009 and is widely used for building scalable and high-performance server-side applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it well-suited for real-time web applications.</p>
<p>It also provides a large ecosystem of packages and modules, including Express.js, Koa.js, and Hapi, which make it easy to build and deploy applications.<br> Node.js is also used for building desktop and mobile applications, as well as for creating microservices and IoT applications</p>
<h1><b>REACTJS</b></h1>
<p>React is a library for building composable user interfaces. It encourages the creation of reusable UI components, which present data that changes over time.<br> Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. React abstracts away the DOM from you, offering a simpler programming model and better performance.</p>
<p>React can also render on the server using Node, and it can power native apps using React Native. React implements one-way reactive data flow, which reduces the boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.</p>
